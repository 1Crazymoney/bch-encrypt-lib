# bch-encrypt-lib

This is a JavaScript npm library that contains several helpful functions for
doing encryption with the Bitcoin Cash protocol. It supports encrypting and
decrypting arbitrary data (like messages or files) using the same eliptic curve
cryptography used by Bitcoin.

This library is primarily used by [message.FullStack.cash](https://message.fullstack.cash)
and the [encrypt-msg](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/encrypt-msg) command line app.
